# asymptotic_theory_calculations

## Purpose:
- This program calculates the diffusivities by solving the asymptotic theory equation from Aharon and Shaw using Bisection method.

- The program also returns the uncertainty in the diffusivity calculations using the Taylor Series Method.

- The main program is contained in the file "asymTheoryDiffusivity.f90".

- To compile envoke "make -f makefile" in the command prompt.

- You can change the experimental data input variables in "fcprops.txt".
