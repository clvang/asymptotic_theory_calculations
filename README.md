# asymptotic_theory_calculations

## Purpose:
- This program calculates the diffusivities by solving the asymptotic theory equation from Aharon and Shaw using Bisection method.

- The main program is contained in the file "asymTheoryDiffusivity.f90"

- To compile envoke "make -f makefile" in the command prompt
